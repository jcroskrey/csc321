#### Question 1

There are six different things listed in the output of the arp -a command.

#### Question 2
I can see 5 different devices. Two of them don't have a company listed with them. One device is our Technicolor TV. Another is a microsoft device, probably the xbox. The last one that has a company is a Google device, I'm not sure what that is. One of the two devices with no company listed could be the amazon echo we own. I'm not sure what the last one could be. All of the devices have question marks under the Name column. 


#### Question 3

When a ping is sent to google.com, the packets are sent to a host that is beyond the local subnet (i.e. google.com). When a ping is sent to localhost, the packets stay within the local subnet and the ping shows the address it resolved to, 127.0.0.1, which is your loopback address. This address is used to point software back to your local machine to create a home network.
