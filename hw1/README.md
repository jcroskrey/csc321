#### Question 2



#### Question 3

When a ping is sent to google.com, the packets are sent to a host that is beyond the local subnet (i.e. google.com). When a ping is sent to localhost, the packets stay within the local subnet and the ping shows the address it resolved to, 127.0.0.1, which is your loopback address. This address is used to point software back to your local machine to create a home network.
